# Character animation project

## 3D models
### Characters used

The models used, found in the directory characters/, were copied 'as is'
from the _cally_ demo, which can be downloaded in the main page of the
[Cal3d](https://mp3butcher.github.io/Cal3D/) library. They are not part
of the _charanim_ project.

### Other models

For the sake of debugging and of embellishing a scene (as much as a
computer scientist can), some simple 3d models were designed for such
purpose. These are found in the _models/_ directory and _are_ part of
the _charanim_ project, so the license in file [LICENSE]() also applies
to them (or at least, it should).

## Context

This project was developed during the first semester of the academic
year 2018-2019 as part of the Computer Animation course project from the
Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics (MIRI).
